1. std::vector based attributes:
- Semantics of arithmetic operation are consequence of std::vector template
- Memory allocation and exception handling is done by std::vector

2. Template must be constrained based in the SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error). See constraint on
operator + :
    template<std::__enable_if_t<std::is_arithmetic<T>::value, bool>>
    //It is constrained to be compiled only for arithmetic objects.
